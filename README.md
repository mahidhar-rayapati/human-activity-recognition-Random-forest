# human-activity-recognition-Random-forest
## To create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the activity of a human (walking,walking-upstairs,walkingdownstairs,sitting,standing, laying), using data from a phone attached to the belt.(Dataset from kaggle).
## Random Forest Classifier:
- Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. 
- It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML.
- This algorithm is a combination of multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem. 
- This alogo contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
- Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output. 
- The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.
## Why random forest:
- It takes less training time as compared to other algorithms.
- It predicts output with high accuracy, even for the large dataset it runs efficiently.
- It can also maintain accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing
